# Day 4 - Todo API Project

This is my Day 4 mini project where I built a **Todo List API** using Node.js and Express.  
The goal was to practice making a clean API with middlewares, routes, and proper code structure.

# What the API Does

 Create, read, update, and delete tasks  
 Toggle task completion  
 Filter tasks by completed status  
 Search tasks by title  
 Logs every request  
 Handles errors and returns clean messages  
 CORS enabled  
 Uses `.env` for configuration
