# Day 3 - Express.js + RESTful APIs + Nodemon

 Created `day3-express-api` and initialized npm  
 Setup server without Express, tested it  
 Setup Express server with `server.js`  
 Installed `express` & `nodemon`, added scripts (`start`, `dev`)  
 Created `routes/students.js` with in-memory array  
 Implemented CRUD routes:
   GET all students  
   GET by ID  
   POST new student  
   PUT update student  
   DELETE student  
 Used `res.json()` for responses  
 Added console logs & 404 handling

 Optional separate server `studentServer.js` on port 4000  
 Project fully functional
